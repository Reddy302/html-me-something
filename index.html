            <p>Caticorns are mythical creatures that come in different shapes, sizes, and colors. Here are some of the most common characteristics of these meowgical creatures.</p>
            <h3>Head</h3>
            <p>The head of a Caticorn is very similar to the head of a cat. Below are some of the differences you might find.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Unicorn Horn</li>
                <li>Mane
                    <ul>
                    <li>Some Caticorns have brightly colored manes. Some lack this feature.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Body</h3>
            <p>The body of a Caticorn is almost exactly the same as the body of a standard cat. Some Caticorns have a brightly colored mohawk-like stripe extending from mane to tail.</p>
            <h3>Tail</h3>
            <p>Some Caticorns have brightly colored tails that resemble a standard cat tail. Others have tails that resemble that of a unicorn which are also brightly colored.</p>

            <h2>Where can I find a Caticorn?</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>In your dreams.</strong> These elusive creatures are very good at hiding. A person may go their entire lives without ever seeing a Caticorn. If the right ritual is performed before laying down to rest, one might be lucky enough to see a real Caticorn.</li>
                <li><strong>Over the rainbow.</strong> Most people will never have the chance to make it over the rainbow. <em>If</em> you are lucky enough to find yourself on the other side of a rainbow, (you will know that the side is "other" when you see a leprechaun's pot of gold) you will still find the task of finding a Caticorn daunting; but don't fret, they are there!</li>
                <li><strong>Within the spectrum of light.</strong> When a beam of light is split into its spectrum, magic happens. Caticorns can be found anywhere that magic exists. The light spectrum is a Caticorn's true playground.</li>
